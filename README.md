# Weatherapi
A project that had us use an API to create a weather forecast website. It takes from the open-meteo API to do this.

## Description

For this project, we were tasked with making a weather forecast weather site using an API. We decided on an open-meteo API
as it was a good starting point for learning to use API tools and it gave us a nice selection of weather options.
Opting for a readable and functional design, we opted for simple styling to make sure the purpose of being a weather forecaster
was not overshadowed.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
